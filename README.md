# Go Workspace 🚀

Welcome to my **Go Workspace**!  
This is where I'm learning **Go** by building projects and exploring the language.

## 📚 About

I'm currently learning **Go (Golang)** and working on multiple sub-projects in this workspace.  
Each project will live in its own subdirectory.

## 🛠️ Projects

- **go-basics** → Simple Go programs to learn syntax and core concepts
- **lofi-cli** → A CLI app to play random Lofi music 🎵 *(upcoming)*
- More projects coming soon 🚀

## 💡 Goals

- Learn Go step by step.
- Build real-world CLI apps and backend tools.
- Push everything to GitHub for reference and sharing.

## 📌 Notes

> This repository is for **learning purposes** — it’s my personal Go playground.
